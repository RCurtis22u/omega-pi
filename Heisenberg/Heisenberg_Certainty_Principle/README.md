# Heisenberg Certainty Principle

This folder contains a full theoretical and experimental simulation showing that the uncertainty principle,
as traditionally understood, can be structurally replaced by a deterministic model using the omega-pi framework.

## Summary

We demonstrate that:
- A qubit's wavefunction can be tracked in both position and momentum space
- Energy curvature and its time derivative allow real-time momentum inference
- The wave function never collapses; it merely dephases through node misalignment
- Quantum uncertainty is replaced with measurable, structural field behavior
