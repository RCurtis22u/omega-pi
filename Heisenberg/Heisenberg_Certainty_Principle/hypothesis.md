# Hypothesis: Heisenberg Certainty Principle

We hypothesize that quantum uncertainty is not fundamental, but a result of ignoring the structural properties
of the wave's environment. By modeling the field as a recursive golden-shell structure (omega-pi),
we show that both position and momentum of a qubit-like wave function can be known simultaneously through:

- Local curvature = position encoding
- Temporal curvature shift = momentum encoding

If correct, this nullifies the traditional uncertainty barrier.
