# Qubit Tracking Simulation — Omega-Pi Method

1. Create a wavefunction from a superposition of two spatial harmonics.
2. Compute local curvature to approximate field compression (energy density).
3. Step forward in time and recompute curvature.
4. Subtract to get ΔEnergy, which correlates with momentum direction and magnitude.
5. Plot the results:
    - Blue: Energy at t0
    - Orange: Energy at t1
    - Purple: ΔEnergy (momentum signal)
